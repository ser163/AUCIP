# AUCIP (AI Universal Capability Interface Protocol)

## Project Overview

AUCIP (AI Universal Capability Interface Protocol) is an open-source protocol designed to provide a standardized communication interface between AI systems and traditional applications, including mobile apps and PC programs. Through this protocol, AI can query and invoke the capabilities of different applications, enabling interoperability across platforms and applications.

Whether it's a desktop application, mobile app, or IoT device, as long as it adheres to the AUCIP protocol standard, it can be managed and called by the AI system. This provides a reliable technical framework for AI-driven automation, cross-system integration, and intelligent task execution.

## Protocol Goals

The AUCIP protocol has the following main goals:

- **Unified Interface**: Provides a standardized communication interface between AI and applications, simplifying interoperability across different platforms and tech stacks.
- **Capability Management**: Supports AI systems in querying the capabilities of applications and making function calls based on permissions.
- **Efficient Invocation**: Provides clear and concise capability declaration and execution interfaces, ensuring the efficiency and security of calls.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Supports applications across various operating systems and device platforms, using a unified protocol for invocation.
